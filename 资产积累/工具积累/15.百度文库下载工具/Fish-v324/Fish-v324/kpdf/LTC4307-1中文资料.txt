The HDMI speci? cation requires that devices have less than 50pF of input capacitance on their DDC bus lines. The LTC4307-1’s capacitance buffering feature, in conjunction with its sub-10pF data and clock input capacitance, allows HDMI components to easily meet the 50pF requirement and tolerate high capacitance on the internal bus.The LTC4307-1 also provides level-shifting between 3.3V and 5V systems to allow lower voltage HDMI transmitters, receivers and EEPROM to interface to the 5V DDC bus. READY is an open-drain digital output ? ag that indicates whether or not the input and output busses are connected and can interface to the HDMI hot plug detect (HPD) signal. When driven high, the ENABLE digital input allows the LTC4307-1 to connect after a stop bit or bus idle. Driving ENABLE low breaks the connection between the input and output busses.■ HDMI■ 3.3V/5V Level Translation■ Capacitance Buffer/Bus Extender■ Bidirectional Buffer for Display Data Channel (DDC)■ Compliant with HDMI Speci? cation Version 1.3 DDC Capacitance Requirement■ Level Translation Between 3.3V and 5V■ ±5kV Human Body Model ESD Protection■ 60mV Buffer Offset Independent of Load■ Compatible with Non-Compliant VOL I2C Devices■ Isolates Input SDA and SCL Line from Output■ Compatible with I2CTM, I2C Fast Mode and SMBus ■ READY Open-Drain Output■ High Impedance SDA, SCL Pins for VCC = 0V■ Small 8-Lead (3mm × 3mm) DFN and 8-Lead MSOP PackagesAPPLICATIOSUFEATURESDESCRIPTIOUTYPICAL APPLICATIOURising Edge from Asserted Low      , LT, LTC and LTM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.Protected by U.S. Patents, including 7032051, 6356140, 6650174LTC4307-1GNDVCCSDAINSCLIN1.8k1.8k10k10k0.1μF43071 TA01a3.3V5VDDC GROUNDTV (SINK)DVD PLAYER (SOURCE)<50pFHDMI RXICHDMICABLEEEPROMSDAOUTSCLOUTENABLEμCHDMI TXIC100ns/DIV00100200300400600500200mV/DIV200400600800100043071 TA01bSDAOUTSDAINLOWOFFSET元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

43071faPI FUCTIOSUUUENABLE (Pin 1): Connection Enable Input. This is a 1.4V digital threshold input pin. For normal operation pull or tie ENABLE high. Driving ENABLE below 0.8V isolates SDAIN from SDAOUT, SCLIN from SCLOUT and asserts READY low. A rising edge on ENABLE after a fault has occurred forces a connection between SDAIN, SDAOUT and SCLIN, SCLOUT. Connect to VCC if unused.SCLOUT (Pin 2): Serial Clock Output. Connect this pin to the clock line of a DDC bus. A pull-up resistor should be connected between this pin and a supply voltage greater than or equal to the VCC voltage. SCLIN (Pin 3): Serial Clock Input. Connect this pin to the clock line of a DDC bus. A pull-up resistor should be connected between this pin and a supply voltage greater than or equal to the VCC voltage. GND (Pin 4): Device Ground. Connect this pin to a ground plane for best results.READY (Pin 5): Connection READY Status Output. The READY pin is an open-drain N-channel MOSFET output that pulls low when ENABLE is low, or when the start-up and connection sequence described in the Operation section has not been completed. READY goes high when ENABLE is high and a connection is made. READY can be used to control the HDMI HPD signal. Connect a pull-up resistor, typically 10k, from this pin to VCC to provide the pull-up. This pin can be ? oated if unused.SDAIN (Pin 6): Serial Data Input. Connect this pin to the data line of a DDC bus. A pull-up resistor should be con-nected between this pin and a supply voltage greater than or equal to the VCC voltage. SDAOUT (Pin 7): Serial Data Output. Connect this pin to the data line of a DDC bus. A pull-up resistor should be connected between this pin and a supply voltage greater than or equal to the VCC voltage. VCC (Pin 8): Supply Voltage Input. Place a bypass capacitor of at least 0.01μF close to VCC for best results.Exposed Pad (Pin 9, DFN Package Only): Exposed Pad may be left open or connected to device ground.元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

43071faFigure 2. Input-Output Falling Edge WaveformsOPERATIONINPUT SIDE150pF1V/DIVOUTPUT SIDE50pF1V/DIV200ns/DIV43071 F02Start-UpWhen the LTC4307-1 ? rst receives power on its VCC pin during power-up, it starts in an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) state, ignoring any activity on the SDA or SCL pins until VCC rises above 2V (typ). This is to ensure that the LTC4307-1 does not try to function until it has enough voltage to do so. Once the LTC4307-1 comes out of UVLO, it monitors both 2-wire busses for either a stop bit or bus idle condition to indicate the completion of data transactions. When both sides are idle or one side has a stop bit condition while the other is idle, the input-to-output connection circuitry is acti-vated, joining SDAIN to SDAOUT and SCLIN to SCLOUT. Connection CircuitryOnce the connection circuitry is activated, the functionality of the SDAIN and SDAOUT pins is identical. A low forced on either pin at any time results in both pin voltages being low. The LTC4307-1 is tolerant of I2C bus DC logic low voltages up to the 0.3VCC VIL I2C speci? cation. When the LTC4307-1 senses a rising edge on the bus, it deactivates its pull-down devices for bus voltages as low as 0.48V. Care must be taken to ensure that devices participating in clock stretching or arbitration force logic low voltages below 0.48V at the LTC4307-1 inputs.SDAIN and SDAOUT enter a logic high state only when all devices on both SDAIN and SDAOUT release high. The same is true for SCLIN and SCLOUT. This important feature ensures that clock stretching, clock synchroniza-tion, arbitration and the acknowledge protocol always work, regardless of how the devices in the system are tied to the LTC4307-1.Another key feature of the connection circuitry is that it provides bidirectional buffering, keeping the capacitances of the two 2-wire busses isolated from each other. Plac-ing an LTC4307-1 close to an HDMI port inside an HDMI transmitter or receiver allows the HDMI device to pass the capacitance compliance speci? cation. Because of this isolation, the waveforms on SDAIN and SCLIN look slightly different than the corresponding waveforms on SDAOUT and SCLOUT as described here. Input to Output Offset Voltage When a logic low voltage, VLOW1, is driven on any of the LTC4307-1’s data or clock pins, the LTC4307-1 regulates the voltage on the opposite data or clock pins to a slightly higher voltage, typically 60mV above VLOW1. This offset is practically independent of pull-up current (see the Typical Performance curves).Propagation DelaysDuring a rising edge, the rise time on each side is de-termined by the bus pull-up resistor and the equivalent capacitance on the line. If the pull-up resistors are the same, a difference in rise time occurs which is directly proportional to the difference in capacitance between the two sides. Users must account for differences in the RC time constants between the two 2-wire busses and ensure that all system timing speci? cations are met on both busses. There is a ? nite propagation delay through the connection circuitry for falling waveforms. Figure 2 shows the falling edge waveforms for VCC = 5.5V, a 10k pull-up resistor on each side, 150pF parasitic capacitance on the input bus and 50pF on the output pins. An external N-channel MOSFET device pulls down the voltage on the side with 150pF capacitance; the LTC4307-1 pulls down the voltage on the opposite side with a delay of 80ns. This delay is always positive and is a function of supply voltage, temperature and the pull-up resistors and equivalent bus capacitances on both sides of the bus. The Typical Performance Charac-teristics section shows propagation delay as a function of temperature and voltage for 10k pull-up resistors and 50pF equivalent capacitance on both sides of the part. Also, the tPHL vs COUT curve for VCC = 5.5V shows that increasing the 元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

43071faOPERATIONFigure 3 shows the LTC4307-1 in a capacitance buffering application. Due to the LTC4307-1’s capacitance buffering feature and sub-10pF input capacitance, this application circuit passes the HDMI 50pF maximum DDC capacitance speci? cation easily when the LTC4307-1 is located right at the HDMI connector interface as shown. The capacitance of the internal bus connected to the SDAIN and SCLIN pins may be much larger than 50pF, but because of the LTC4307-1’s capacitance buffering, the internal bus ca-pacitance is isolated from the HDMI connector.APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONIn HDMI, the sink device pulls the hot plug detect HPD signal high to tell the source that it is ready to accept commands through the DDC. This signal can be controlled through the READY pin of the LTC4307-1 to prevent the possibility of erroneous attempts by the source to contact the sink before the sink is ready to return its extended display identi? cation data (EDID). The READY pin only goes high after 5V is applied and the LTC4307-1 ENABLE pin is pulled high by the HDMI receiver IC, a controller in the sink, or the 5V line itself.capacitance from 50pF to 150pF results in a tPHL increase from 81ns to 91ns. Larger output capacitances translate to longer delays (up to 125ns). Users must quantify the difference in propagation times for a rising edge versus a falling edge in their systems and adjust setup and hold times accordingly.READY Digital Output This pin provides a digital ? ag which is low when either ENABLE is low or the start-up sequence described earlier in this section has not been completed. READY goes high when ENABLE is high and the input and output 2-wire busses are connected. The pin is driven by an open-drain pull-down capable of sinking 3mA while holding 0.4V on the pin. Connect a resistor to VCC to provide the pull-up. READY can be used to control the HDMI hot plug detect (HPD) signal to prevent the possibility of erroneous at-tempts by the source to contact the sink before the sink is ready to communicate.ENABLEWhen the ENABLE pin is driven below 0.8V with respect to the LTC4307-1’s ground, the input 2-wire bus is discon-nected from the output 2-wire bus and the READY pin is internally pulled low. When the pin is driven above 2V, the part waits for data transactions on both 2-wire bus-ses to be complete (as described in the Start-Up section) before connecting the two sides. At this time the internal pull-down on READY releases. LTC4307 and LTC4307-1 Feature DifferencesThe LTC4307-1 HDMI level-shifting 2-wire bus buffer is speci? cally intended for HDMI applications. Features in the general purpose LTC4307 device that are not required in HDMI systems have been removed. In addition, level-shifting functionality has been added to the LTC4307-1 to allow 3.3V HDMI devices to interface safely to the 5V HDMI DDC bus.
