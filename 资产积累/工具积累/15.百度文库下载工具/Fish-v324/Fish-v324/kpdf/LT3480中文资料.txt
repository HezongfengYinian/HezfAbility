A high ef? ciency 0.25 switch is included on the die along with a boost Schottky diode and the necessary oscillator, con-trol, and logic circuitry. Current mode topology is used for fast transient response and good loop stability. Low ripple Burst Mode operation maintains high ef? ciency at low output currents while keeping output ripple below 15mV in a typical application. In addition, the LT3480 can further enhance low output current ef? ciency by draw-ing bias current from the output when VOUT is above 3V. Shutdown reduces input supply current to less than 1μA while a resistor and capacitor on the RUN/SS pin provide a controlled output voltage ramp (soft-start). A power good ? ag signals when VOUT reaches 86% of the programmed output voltage. The LT3480 is available in 10-Pin MSOP and 3mm × 3mm DFN packages with exposed pads for low thermal resistance.n Wide Input Range:Operation from 3.6V to 36VOver-Voltage Lockout Protects Circuits through 60V Transientsn 2A Maximum Output Currentn Low Ripple Burst Mode?

3480fb PIN FUNCTIONSBD (Pin 1): This pin connects to the anode of the boost Schottky diode. BD also supplies current to the internal regulator.BOOST (Pin 2): This pin is used to provide a drive voltage, higher than the input voltage, to the internal bipolar NPN power switch.SW (Pin 3): The SW pin is the output of the internal power switch. Connect this pin to the inductor, catch diode and boost capacitor.VIN (Pin 4): The VIN pin supplies current to the LT3480’s internal regulator and to the internal power switch. This pin must be locally bypassed.RUN/SS (Pin 5): The RUN/SS pin is used to put the LT3480 in shutdown mode. Tie to ground to shut down the LT3480. Tie to 2.5V or more for normal operation. If the shutdown feature is not used, tie this pin to the VIN pin. RUN/SS also provides a soft-start function; see the Applications Information section.SYNC (Pin 6): This is the external clock synchronization input. Ground this pin for low ripple Burst Mode operation at low output loads. Tie to a clock source for synchronization. Clock edges should have rise and fall times faster than 1μs. See synchronizing section in Applications Information.PG (Pin 7): The PG pin is the open collector output of an internal comparator. PG remains low until the FB pin is within 14% of the ? nal regulation voltage. PG output is valid when VIN is above 3.6V and RUN/SS is high.FB (Pin 8): The LT3480 regulates the FB pin to 0.790V. Connect the feedback resistor divider tap to this pin.VC (Pin 9): The VC pin is the output of the internal error ampli? er. The voltage on this pin controls the peak switch current.

3480fb OPERATIONThe LT3480 is a constant frequency, current mode step-down regulator. An oscillator, with frequency set by RT, enables an RS ? ip-? op, turning on the internal power switch. An ampli? er and comparator monitor the current ? owing between the VIN and SW pins, turning the switch off when this current reaches a level determined by the voltage at VC. An error ampli? er measures the output voltage through an external resistor divider tied to the FB pin and servos the VC pin. If the error ampli? er’s output increases, more current is delivered to the output; if it decreases, less current is delivered. An active clamp on the VC pin provides current limit. The VC pin is also clamped to the voltage on the RUN/SS pin; soft-start is implemented by generating a voltage ramp at the RUN/SS pin using an external resistor and capacitor. An internal regulator provides power to the control circuitry. The bias regulator normally draws power from the VIN pin, but if the BD pin is connected to an external voltage higher than 3V bias power will be drawn from the external source (typically the regulated output voltage). This improves ef? ciency. The RUN/SS pin is used to place the LT3480 in shutdown, disconnecting the output and reducing the input current to less than 1μA. The switch driver operates from either the input or from the BOOST pin. An external capacitor and diode are used to generate a voltage at the BOOST pin that is higher than the input supply. This allows the driver to fully saturate the internal bipolar NPN power switch for ef? cient operation.To further optimize ef? ciency, the LT3480 automatically switches to Burst Mode operation in light load situations. Between bursts, all circuitry associated with controlling the output switch is shut down, reducing the input supply current to 70μA in a typical application.The oscillator reduces the LT3480’s operating frequency when the voltage at the FB pin is low. This frequency foldback helps to control the output current during startup and overload. The LT3480 contains a power good comparator which trips when the FB pin is at 86% of its regulated value. The PG output is an open-collector transistor that is off when the output is in regulation, allowing an external resistor to pull the PG pin high. Power good is valid when the LT3480 is enabled and VIN is above 3.6V.The LT3480 has an overvoltage protection feature which disables switching action when the VIN goes above 38V typical (36V minimum). When switching is disabled, the LT3480 can safely sustain input voltages up to 60V.元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONFB Resistor NetworkThe output voltage is programmed with a resistor divider between the output and the FB pin. Choose the 1% resis-tors according to: RRVVOUT120791=-??????.Reference designators refer to the Block Diagram.Setting the Switching FrequencyThe LT3480 uses a constant frequency PWM architecture that can be programmed to switch from 200kHz to 2.4MHz by using a resistor tied from the RT pin to ground. A table showing the necessary RT value for a desired switching frequency is in Figure 1.SWITCHING FREQUENCY (MHz)RT VALUE (kΩ)0.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.01.21.41.61.82.02.22.418712188.768.156.246.440.23429.423.719.116.213.311.59.768.66Figure 1. Switching Frequency vs. RT ValueOperating Frequency TradeoffsSelection of the operating frequency is a tradeoff between ef? ciency, component size, minimum dropout voltage, and maximum input voltage. The advantage of high frequency operation is that smaller inductor and capacitor values may be used. The disadvantages are lower ef? ciency, lower maximum input voltage, and higher dropout voltage. The highest acceptable switching frequency (fSW(MAX)) for a given application can be calculated as follows: fVVtVVVSWMAXDOUTONMINDINSW()()C=++()where VIN is the typical input voltage, VOUT is the output voltage, VD is the catch diode drop (~0.5V) and VSW is the internal switch drop (~0.5V at max load). This equation shows that slower switching frequency is necessary to safely accommodate high VIN/VOUT ratio. Also, as shown in the next section, lower frequency allows a lower dropout voltage. The reason input voltage range depends on the switching frequency is because the LT3480 switch has ? nite minimum on and off times. The switch can turn on for a minimum of ~150ns and turn off for a minimum of ~150ns. Typical minimum on time at 25°C is 80ns. This means that the minimum and maximum duty cycles are: DCftDCftMINSWONMINMAXSWOFFMIN==()()C1where fSW is the switching frequency, the tON(MIN) is the minimum switch on time (~150ns), and the tOFF(MIN) is the minimum switch off time (~150ns). These equations show that duty cycle range increases when switching frequency is decreased. A good choice of switching frequency should allow ad-equate input voltage range (see next section) and keep the inductor and capacitor values small. Input Voltage RangeThe maximum input voltage for LT3480 applications depends on switching frequency, the Absolute Maximum Ratings of the VIN and BOOST pins, and the operating mode.The LT3480 can operate from input voltages up to 38V, and safely withstand input voltages up 60V. Note that while VIN>38V (typical), the LT3480 will stop switching, allowing the output to fall out of regulation.While the output is in start-up, short-circuit, or other overload conditions, the switching frequency should be chosen according to the following discussion.For safe operation at inputs up to 60V the switching fre-quency must be set low enough to satisfy VIN(MAX) ≥ 40V according to the following equation. If lower VIN(MAX) is desired, this equation can be used directly.元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATION VVVftVVINMAXOUTDSWONMINDSW()()C=++where VIN(MAX) is the maximum operating input voltage, VOUT is the output voltage, VD is the catch diode drop (~0.5V), VSW is the internal switch drop (~0.5V at max load), fSW is the switching frequency (set by RT), and tON(MIN) is the minimum switch on time (~150ns). Note that a higher switching frequency will depress the maximum operating input voltage. Conversely, a lower switching frequency will be necessary to achieve safe operation at high input voltages.If the output is in regulation and no short-circuit, start-up, or overload events are expected, then input voltage transients of up to 60V are acceptable regardless of the switching frequency. In this mode, the LT3480 may enter pulse skipping operation where some switching pulses are skipped to maintain output regulation. In this mode the output voltage ripple and inductor current ripple will be higher than in normal operation. Above 38V switching will stop.The minimum input voltage is determined by either the LT3480’s minimum operating voltage of ~3.6V or by its maximum duty cycle (see equation in previous section). The minimum input voltage due to duty cycle is: VVVftVVINMINOUTDSWOFFMINDSW()()CC=++1where VIN(MIN) is the minimum input voltage, and tOFF(MIN) is the minimum switch off time (150ns). Note that higherswitching frequency will increase the minimum input voltage. If a lower dropout voltage is desired, a lower switching frequency should be used.Inductor SelectionFor a given input and output voltage, the inductor value and switching frequency will determine the ripple current. The ripple current ΔIL increases with higher VIN or VOUT and decreases with higher inductance and faster switching frequency. A reasonable starting point for selecting the ripple current is: ΔIL = 0.4(IOUT(MAX)) where IOUT(MAX) is the maximum output load current. To guarantee suf? cient output current, peak inductor current must be lower than the LT3480’s switch current limit (ILIM). The peak inductor current is: IL(PEAK) = IOUT(MAX) + ΔIL/2where IL(PEAK) is the peak inductor current, IOUT(MAX) is the maximum output load current, and ΔIL is the inductor ripple current. The LT3480’s switch current limit (ILIM) is at least 3.5A at low duty cycles and decreases linearly to 2.5A at DC = 0.8. The maximum output current is a func-tion of the inductor ripple current: IOUT(MAX) = ILIM C ΔIL/2Be sure to pick an inductor ripple current that provides suf? cient maximum output current (IOUT(MAX)).The largest inductor ripple current occurs at the highest VIN. To guarantee that the ripple current stays below the speci? ed maximum, the inductor value should be chosen according to the following equation:  LVVfIVVVOUTDSWLOUTDINMAX=+??????+?????Δ1C()?where VD is the voltage drop of the catch diode (~0.4V), VIN(MAX) is the maximum input voltage, VOUT is the output voltage, fSW is the switching frequency (set by RT), and L is in the inductor value. The inductor’s RMS current rating must be greater than the maximum load current and its saturation current should be about 30% higher. For robust operation in fault conditions (start-up or short circuit) and high input voltage (>30V), the saturation current should be above 3.5A. To keep the ef? ciency high, the series resistance (DCR) should be less than 0.1, and the core material should be intended for high frequency applications. Table 1 lists several vendors and suitable types.元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

A larger value inductor provides a slightly higher maximum load current and will reduce the output voltage ripple. If your load is lower than 2A, then you can decrease the value of the inductor and operate with higher ripple current. This allows you to use a physically smaller inductor, or one with a lower DCR resulting in higher ef? ciency. There are several graphs in the Typical Performance Characteristics section of this data sheet that show the maximum load current as a function of input voltage and inductor value for several popular output voltages. Low inductance may result in discontinuous mode operation, which is okay but further reduces maximum load current. For details of maximum output current and discontinuous mode operation, see Linear Technology Ap-plication Note 44. Finally, for duty cycles greater than 50% (VOUT/VIN > 0.5), there is a minimum inductance required to avoid subharmonic oscillations. See AN19. Input CapacitorBypass the input of the LT3480 circuit with a ceramic capaci-tor of X7R or X5R type. Y5V types have poor performance over temperature and applied voltage, and should not be used. A 4.7μF to 10μF ceramic capacitor is adequate to bypass the LT3480 and will easily handle the ripple current. Note that larger input capacitance is required when a lower switching frequency is used. If the input power source has high impedance, or there is signi? cant inductance due to long wires or cables, additional bulk capacitance may be necessary. This can be provided with a lower performance electrolytic capacitor. Step-down regulators draw current from the input supply in pulses with very fast rise and fall times. The input capaci-tor is required to reduce the resulting voltage ripple at the LT3480 and to force this very high frequency switching current into a tight local loop, minimizing EMI. A 4.7μF capacitor is capable of this task, but only if it is placed close to the LT3480 and the catch diode (see the PCB Layout section). A second precaution regarding the ceramic input capacitor concerns the maximum input voltage rating of the LT3480. A ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable inductance forms a high quality (under damped) tank circuit. If the LT3480 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the input voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possibly exceeding the LT3480’s voltage rating. This situation is easily avoided (see the Hot Plugging Safety section).For space sensitive applications, a 2.2μF ceramic capacitor can be used for local bypassing of the LT3480 input. However, the lower input capacitance will result in increased input current ripple and input voltage ripple, and may couple noise into other circuitry. Also, the increased voltage ripple will raise the minimum operating voltage of the LT3480 to ~3.7V. Output Capacitor and Output RippleThe output capacitor has two essential functions. Along with the inductor, it ? lters the square wave generated by the LT3480 to produce the DC output. In this role it determines the output ripple, and low impedance at the switching frequency is important. The second function is to store energy in order to satisfy transient loads and stabilize the LT3480’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors have very low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and provide the best ripple performance. A good starting value is: CVfOUTOUTSW=100where fSW is in MHz, and COUT is the recommended output capacitance in μF. Use X5R or X7R types. This choice will provide low output ripple and good transient response. Transient performance can be improved with a higher value 元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONcapacitor if the compensation network is also adjusted to maintain the loop bandwidth. A lower value of output capacitor can be used to save space and cost but transient performance will suffer. See the Frequency Compensation section to choose an appropriate compensation network.When choosing a capacitor, look carefully through the data sheet to ? nd out what the actual capacitance is under operating conditions (applied voltage and temperature). A physically larger capacitor, or one with a higher voltage rating, may be required. High performance tantalum or electrolytic capacitors can be used for the output capacitor. Low ESR is important, so choose one that is intended for use in switching regulators. The ESR should be speci? ed by the supplier, and should be 0.05 or less. Such a capacitor will be larger than a ceramic capacitor and will have a larger capacitance, because the capacitor must be large to achieve low ESR. Table 2 lists several capacitor vendors.Catch DiodeThe catch diode conducts current only during switch off time. Average forward current in normal operation can be calculated from: ID(AVG) = IOUT (VIN C VOUT)/VINwhere IOUT is the output load current. The only reason to consider a diode with a larger current rating than necessary for nominal operation is for the worst-case condition of shorted output. The diode current will then increase to the typical peak switch current. Peak reverse voltage is equal to the regulator input voltage. Use a Schottky diode with a reverse voltage rating greater than the input voltage. The overvoltage protection feature in the LT3480 will keep the switch off when VIN > 38V which allows the use of 40V rated Schottky even when VIN ranges up to 60V. Table 3 lists several Schottky diodes and their manufacturers.Table 3.

However, ceramic capacitors can cause problems when used with the LT3480 due to their piezoelectric nature. When in Burst Mode operation, the LT3480’s switching frequency depends on the load current, and at very light loads the LT3480 can excite the ceramic capacitor at audio frequencies, generating audible noise.

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONoperation, the noise is typically very quiet to a casual ear. If this is unacceptable, use a high performance tantalum  or electrolytic capacitor at the output.A ? nal precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns the maximum input voltage rating of the LT3480. A ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable inductance forms a high quality (under damped) tank circuit. If the LT3480 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the input volt-age can ring to twice its nominal value, possibly exceeding the LT3480’s rating. This situation is easily avoided (see the Hot Plugging Safely section).Frequency CompensationThe LT3480 uses current mode control to regulate the output. This simpli? es loop compensation. In particular, the LT3480 does not require the ESR of the output capacitor for stability, so you are free to use ceramic capacitors to achieve low output ripple and small circuit size. Frequency compensation is provided by the components tied to the VC pin, as shown in Figure 2. Generally a capacitor (CC) and a resistor (RC) in series to ground are used. In addi-tion, there may be lower value capacitor in parallel. This capacitor (CF) is not part of the loop compensation but is used to ? lter noise at the switching frequency, and is required only if a phase-lead capacitor is used or if the output capacitor has high ESR.Loop compensation determines the stability and transient performance. Designing the compensation network is a bit complicated and the best values depend on the application and in particular the type of output capacitor. A practical approach is to start with one of the circuits in this data sheet that is similar to your application and tune the compensation network to optimize the performance. Stability should then be checked across all operating conditions, including load current, input voltage and temperature. The LT1375 data sheet contains a more thorough discussion of loop compensation and describes how to test the stability using a transient load. Figure 2 shows an equivalent circuit for the LT3480 control loop. The error ampli? er is a transconductance ampli? er with ? nite output impedance. The power section, consisting of the modulator, power switch and inductor, is modeled as a transconductance ampli? er generating an output C+0.8VSWVCgm = 420μmhoGND3MLT34803480 F02R1OUTPUTESRCFCCRCERRORAMPLIFIERFBR2C1C1CURRENT MODEPOWER STAGEgm = 3.5mho+POLYMERORTANTALUMCERAMICCPLFigure 2. Model for Loop Responsecurrent proportional to the voltage at the VC pin. Note that the output capacitor integrates this current, and that the capacitor on the VC pin (CC) integrates the error ampli? er output current, resulting in two poles in the loop. In most cases a zero is required and comes from either the output capacitor ESR or from a resistor RC in series with CC. This simple model works well as long as the value of the inductor is not too high and the loop crossover frequency is much lower than the switching frequency. A phase lead capacitor (CPL) across the feedback divider may improve the transient response. Figure 3 shows the transient response when the load current is stepped from 500mA to 1500mA and back to 500mA.Figure 3.

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONoperation at a lower output load current than when in Burst Mode. The front page application circuit will switch at full frequency at output loads higher than about 60mA.BOOST and BIAS Pin ConsiderationsCapacitor C3 and the internal boost Schottky diode (see the Block Diagram) are used to generate a boost voltage that is higher than the input voltage. In most cases a 0.22μF capacitor will work well. Figure 2 shows three ways to arrange the boost circuit. The BOOST pin must be more than 2.3V above the SW pin for best ef? ciency. For outputs of 3V and above, the standard circuit (Figure 5a) is best. For outputs between 2.8V and 3V, use a 1μF boost capacitor. A 2.5V output presents a special case because it is marginally adequate to support the boosted drive stage while using the internal boost diode. For reliable BOOST pin operation with 2.5V outputs use a good external Schottky diode (such as the ON Semi MBR0540), and a 1μF boost capacitor (see Figure 5b). For lower output voltages the boost diode can be tied to the input (Figure 5c), or to another supply greater than 2.8V. Tying BD to VIN reduces the maximum input voltage to 30V. The circuit in Figure 5a is more ef? cient because the BOOST pin current and BD pin quiescent current comes from a lower voltage source. You must also be sure that the maximum voltage ratings of the BOOST and BD pins are not exceeded.The minimum operating voltage of an LT3480 application is limited by the minimum input voltage (3.6V) and by the maximum duty cycle as outlined in a previous section. For proper startup, the minimum input voltage is also limited by the boost circuit. If the input voltage is ramped slowly, or the LT3480 is turned on with its RUN/SS pin when the output is already in regulation, then the boost capacitor may not be fully charged. Because the boost capacitor is charged with the energy stored in the inductor, the circuit will rely on some minimum load current to get the boost circuit running properly. This minimum load will depend on input and output voltages, and on the arrangement of the boost circuit. The minimum load generally goes to zero once the circuit has started. Figure 6 shows a plot of minimum load to start and to run as a function of input voltage. In many cases the discharged output capacitor will present a load to the switcher, which will allow it to start. The plots show Figure 4. Burst Mode Operation3480 F04IL0.2A/DIVVSW5V/DIVVOUT10mV/DIV5μs/DIVVIN = 12V; FRONT PAGE APPLICATIONILOAD= 10mALow-Ripple Burst Mode and Pulse-Skip ModeThe LT3480 is capable of operating in either Low-Ripple Burst Mode or Pulse-Skip Mode which are selected using the SYNC pin. See the Synchronization section for details.To enhance ef? ciency at light loads, the LT3480 can be operated in Low-Ripple Burst Mode operation which keeps the output capacitor charged to the proper voltage while minimizing the input quiescent current. During Burst Mode operation, the LT3480 delivers single cycle bursts of current to the output capacitor followed by sleep periods where the output power is delivered to the load by the output capacitor. Because the LT3480 delivers power to the output with single, low current pulses, the output ripple is kept below 15mV for a typical application. In addition, VIN and BD quiescent currents are reduced to typically 30μA and 80μA respec-tively during the sleep time. As the load current decreases towards a no load condition, the percentage of time that the LT3480 operates in sleep mode increases and the average input current is greatly reduced resulting in high ef? ciency even at very low loads. See Figure 4. At higher output loads (above 140mA for the front page application) the LT3480 will be running at the frequency programmed by the RT resistor, and will be operating in standard PWM mode. The transition between PWM and Low-Ripple Burst Mode is seamless, and will not disturb the output voltage.If low quiescent current is not required the LT3480 can operate in Pulse-Skip mode. The bene? t of this mode is that the LT3480 will enter full frequency standard PWM 元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONthe worst-case situation where VIN is ramping very slowly. For lower start-up voltage, the boost diode can be tied to VIN; however, this restricts the input range to one-half of the absolute maximum rating of the BOOST pin.At light loads, the inductor current becomes discontinu-ous and the effective duty cycle can be very high. This reduces the minimum input voltage to approximately 300mV above VOUT. At higher load currents, the inductor current is continuous and the duty cycle is limited by the maximum duty cycle of the LT3480, requiring a higher input voltage to maintain regulation.VINBOOSTSWBDVINVOUT4.7μFC3GNDLT3480VINBOOSTSWBDVINVOUT4.7μFC3D2GNDLT3480VINBOOSTSWBDVINVOUT4.7μFC3GNDLT34803480 FO5(5a) For VOUT > 2.8V(5b) For 2.5V < VOUT < 2.8V(5c) For VOUT < 2.5V; VIN(MAX) = 30VFigure 6.

Three Circuits For Generating The Boost VoltageSoft-StartThe RUN/SS pin can be used to soft-start the LT3480, reduc-ing the maximum input current during start-up. The RUN/SS pin is driven through an external RC ? lter to create a voltage ramp at this pin. Figure 7 shows the start-up and shut-down waveforms with the soft-start circuit. By choosing a large RC time constant, the peak start-up current can be reduced to the current that is required to regulate the output, with no overshoot. Choose the value of the resistor so that it can supply 20μA when the RUN/SS pin reaches 2.5V.SynchronizationTo select Low-Ripple Burst Mode operation, tie the SYNC pin below 0.3V (this can be ground or a logic output).元器件交易网www.cecb2b.com

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONSynchronizing the LT3480 oscillator to an external fre-quency can be done by connecting a square wave (with 20% to 80% duty cycle) to the SYNC pin. The square wave amplitude should have valleys that are below 0.3V and peaks that are above 0.8V (up to 6V).The LT3480 will not enter Burst Mode at low output loads while synchronized to an external clock, but instead will skip pulses to maintain regulation.The LT3480 may be synchronized over a 250kHz to 2MHz range. The RT resistor should be chosen to set the LT3480 switching frequency 20% below the lowest synchronization input. For example, if the synchronization signal will be 250kHz and higher, the RT should be chosen for 200kHz. To assure reliable and safe operation the LT3480 will only synchronize when the output voltage is near regulation as indicated by the PG ? ag. It is therefore necessary to choose a large enough inductor value to supply the required output current at the frequency set by the RT resistor. See Inductor Selection sec-tion. It is also important to note that slope compensation is set by the RT value: When the sync frequency is much higher than the one set by RT, the slope compensation will be signi? cantly reduced which may require a larger inductor value to prevent subharmonic oscillation.Shorted and Reversed Input ProtectionIf the inductor is chosen so that it won’t saturate excessively, an LT3480 buck regulator will tolerate a shorted output. There is another situation to consider in systems where the output will be held high when the input to the LT3480 is absent. This may occur in battery charging applications or in battery backup systems where a battery or some other supply is diode OR-ed with the LT3480’s output. If the VIN pin is allowed to ? oat and the RUN/SS pin is held high (either by a logic signal or because it is tied to VIN), then the LT3480’s internal circuitry will pull its quiescent current through its SW pin. This is ? ne if your system can tolerate a few mA in this state. If you ground the RUN/SS pin, the SW pin current will drop to essentially zero. However, if the VIN pin is grounded while the output is held high, then parasitic diodes inside the LT3480 can pull large currents from the output through the SW pin and the VIN pin. Figure 8 shows a circuit that will run only when the input voltage is present and that protects against a shorted or reversed input.PCB LayoutFor proper operation and minimum EMI, care must be taken during printed circuit board layout. Figure 9 shows the recommended component placement with trace, ground plane and via locations. Note that large, switched currents ? ow in the LT3480’s VIN and SW pins, the catch diode (D1) and the input capacitor (C1). The loop formed by these components should be as small as possible. These components, along with the inductor and output capacitor, should be placed on the same side of the circuit board, and their connections should be made on that layer. Place a local, unbroken ground plane below these components. The SW and BOOST nodes should be as small as possible. Figure 7.

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONFinally, keep the FB and VC nodes small so that the ground traces will shield them from the SW and BOOST nodes. The Exposed Pad on the bottom of the package must be soldered to ground so that the pad acts as a heat sink. To keep thermal resistance low, extend the ground plane as much as possible, and add thermal vias under and near the LT3480 to additional ground planes within the circuit board and on the bottom side.Hot Plugging SafelyThe small size, robustness and low impedance of ceramic capacitors make them an attractive option for the input bypass capacitor of LT3480 circuits. However, these capaci-tors can cause problems if the LT3480 is plugged into a live supply (see Linear Technology Application Note 88 for a complete discussion).

3480fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATIONsource, forms an under damped tank circuit, and the voltage at the VIN pin of the LT3480 can ring to twice the nominal input voltage, possibly exceeding the LT3480’s rating and damaging the part. If the input supply is poorly controlled or the user will be plugging the LT3480 into an energized supply, the input network should be designed to prevent this overshoot. Figure 10 shows the waveforms that result when an LT3480 circuit is connected to a 24V supply through six feet of 24-gauge twisted pair. The ? rst plot is the response with a 4.7μF ceramic capacitor at the input. The input voltage rings as high as 50V and the input current peaks at 26A. A good solution is shown in Figure 10b. A 0.7 resistor is added in series with the input to eliminate the voltage overshoot (it also reduces the peak input current). A 0.1μF capacitor improves high frequency ? ltering. For high input voltages its impact on ef? ciency is minor, reducing ef? ciency by 1.5 percent for a 5V output at full load operating from 24V.High Temperature ConsiderationsThe PCB must provide heat sinking to keep the LT3480 cool. The Exposed Pad on the bottom of the package must be soldered to a ground plane. This ground should be tied to large copper layers below with thermal vias; these layers will spread the heat dissipated by the LT3480. Place additional vias can reduce thermal resistance further. With these steps, the thermal resistance from die (or junction) to ambient can be reduced to JA = 35°C/W or less. With 100 LFPM air? ow, this resistance can fall by another 25%. Further increases in air? ow will lead to lower thermal resistance. Because of the large output current capability of the LT3480, it is possible to dissipate enough heat to raise the junction temperature beyond the absolute maximum of 125°C. When operating at high ambient temperatures, the maximum load current should be derated as the ambient temperature approaches 125°C.Power dissipation within the LT3480 can be estimated by calculating the total power loss from an ef? ciency measure-ment and subtracting the catch diode loss and inductor loss. The die temperature is calculated by multiplying the LT3480 power dissipation by the thermal resistance from junction to ambient.Other Linear Technology PublicationsApplication Notes 19, 35 and 44 contain more detailed descriptions and design information for buck regulators and other switching regulators.
